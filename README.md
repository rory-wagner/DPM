# DPM (Deterministic Password Manager)

This is a web application (unhosted) that deterministically generates passwords for users.

Gone are the ways of storing passwords for hackers to attack! Instead, generate the passwords on the fly!

## Local Setup BE:

The backend is run with Python3.

It is suggested to use a venv and install all requirements in requirements.txt.

After activating venv and installing the requirements, run `python ./serverSide/server.py`
(Listens on port 8080)

## Local Setup FE:

The frontend was never intended to be big, so it is just an html page.

Simply navigate to the page.
